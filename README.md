# BeatTogether.DedicatedServer
A multiplayer private server for the modding community. Supports crossplay between PC and Quest.
##This branch of the server only runs on windows, and has a handy gui.
I will be adding more stuff to the gui to help debug the dev branch soon

## Note
If you are looking to just play BeatTogether you can download it for your respective platform at the links below. This repository is for contribution to the server that runs the matchmaking services.
